# Power Automate Flows for AI-Powered Customer Support System

## Overview
This document outlines the Power Automate flows needed to automate processes in the AI-Powered Customer Support System. These flows will connect the PowerApps frontend with the Flask backend API and provide additional automation capabilities.

## Flow 1: New Ticket Creation

### Trigger
- When a new ticket is created in PowerApps

### Actions
1. Call Flask API to create a ticket
2. Check if AI can provide an immediate response
3. If AI response is available, update the ticket with the AI response
4. Send notification to customer about ticket creation and AI response
5. If no AI response, add ticket to the unassigned queue

### Outputs
- Ticket ID
- Status (with or without AI response)

## Flow 2: Ticket Assignment

### Trigger
- When an admin assigns a ticket to an agent in PowerApps
- Alternative: Automatic assignment based on agent workload (scheduled flow)

### Actions
1. Call Flask API to assign the ticket
2. Send notification to the assigned agent
3. Update ticket status in PowerApps
4. Add calendar reminder for agent follow-up if no response within 24 hours

### Outputs
- Assignment status
- Agent notification status

## Flow 3: Ticket Resolution

### Trigger
- When an agent resolves a ticket in PowerApps

### Actions
1. Call Flask API to mark ticket as resolved
2. Send resolution notification to customer
3. Update ticket status in PowerApps
4. Add ticket data to reporting database for analytics
5. Create customer satisfaction survey request (optional)

### Outputs
- Resolution status
- Customer notification status

## Flow 4: Escalation for Delayed Tickets

### Trigger
- Scheduled flow that runs daily

### Actions
1. Get all tickets with status "assigned" that haven't been updated in 48 hours
2. Send reminder notification to assigned agents
3. If ticket hasn't been updated in 72 hours, notify supervisor
4. Update ticket with escalation note

### Outputs
- List of escalated tickets
- Notification statuses

## Flow 5: Daily Ticket Summary for Admins

### Trigger
- Scheduled flow that runs daily (end of day)

### Actions
1. Call Flask API to get ticket statistics
2. Format data into a readable report
3. Send email to administrators with summary
4. Save report to SharePoint for historical tracking

### Outputs
- Daily report email
- Archived report in SharePoint

## Flow 6: Customer Feedback Processing

### Trigger
- When customer submits feedback form after ticket resolution

### Actions
1. Save feedback to database
2. If rating is low (1-2 stars), create follow-up task for supervisor
3. Update agent performance metrics
4. Send thank you email to customer for feedback

### Outputs
- Feedback processing status
- Follow-up task (if applicable)

## Implementation Details

### API Connections
- Custom connector to Flask backend API
- Base URL: http://localhost:5000
- Authentication: None (for demo purposes)

### Required Connections
- Office 365 Outlook (for email notifications)
- SharePoint (for report storage)
- PowerApps (for triggering and receiving data)
- SQL Database or Dataverse (for analytics storage)

### Error Handling
- Implement retry logic for API calls (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Send notification to system administrator if critical flows fail
- Log all errors to a central error log for monitoring

## Security Considerations
- Store API credentials in Azure Key Vault
- Use managed identities for connections where possible
- Implement least privilege access for all connections
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest

## Testing Strategy
1. Test each flow individually with sample data
2. Test end-to-end scenarios with PowerApps frontend
3. Verify error handling by simulating failures
4. Perform load testing to ensure flows can handle expected volume

## Deployment Steps
1. Create flows in development environment
2. Test thoroughly with mock data
3. Export solution and import to test environment
4. Validate with end-to-end testing
5. Deploy to production environment

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Set up alerts for failed flows
- Create a dashboard for flow performance metrics
- Schedule regular reviews of flow logs
- Implement version control for flow changes
