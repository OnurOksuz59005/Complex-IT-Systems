# PowerApps Frontend Design for AI-Powered Customer Support System

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation of the PowerApps frontend for the AI-Powered Customer Support System. The frontend will interact with the Flask backend API to provide a user-friendly interface for customers, support agents, and administrators.

## Screens and Components

- **Purpose**: Authenticate users and determine their role (Customer, Agent, Admin)
- **Components**:
  - Username/Email input field
  - Password input field
  - Login button
  - Role selection (optional, can be determined from backend)

### 2. Customer Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Allow customers to create and view their support tickets
- **Components**:
  - "Create New Ticket" button
  - List of user's existing tickets with status indicators
  - Search/filter functionality
  - Notification area for updates

### 3. Create Ticket Form

  - Submit button

### 4. Ticket Detail View
- **Purpose**: Display detailed information about a specific ticket
- **Components**:
  - Ticket information (ID, title, status, creation date)
  - Description and history
  - AI responses (if any)
  - Agent responses (if any)
  - Add comment/reply section
  - Close ticket button (for customers)

### 5. Agent Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Allow support agents to view and manage assigned tickets
- **Components**:
  - List of tickets assigned to the agent
  - List of unassigned tickets
  - Search/filter functionality
  - Performance metrics

### 6. Agent Ticket View
- **Purpose**: Allow agents to work on tickets
- **Components**:
  - Ticket information
  - Customer information
  - AI response history
  - Response text area
  - Resolve ticket button
  - Escalate ticket button (optional)

### 7. Admin Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Provide overview and management capabilities for administrators
- **Components**:
  - System statistics (tickets by status, response times, etc.)
  - Agent performance metrics
  - Configuration settings
  - User management

## Data Sources and Connections

### API Connection
- Create a custom connector to the Flask backend API
- Base URL: http://localhost:5000
- Authentication: None (for demo purposes)

### Endpoints to Use
- `GET /api/tickets` - Retrieve tickets
- `POST /api/tickets` - Create new ticket
- `GET /api/tickets/<ticket_id>` - Get specific ticket
- `POST /api/tickets/<ticket_id>/assign` - Assign ticket
- `POST /api/tickets/<ticket_id>/resolve` - Resolve ticket
- `GET /api/stats` - Get statistics for admin dashboard

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create the PowerApps App**:
   - Create a new canvas app in PowerApps
   - Set up the screens as outlined above
   - Design the UI with consistent styling

2. **Set up API Connection**:
   - Create a custom connector to the Flask backend
   - Test the connection to ensure it works

3. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Create login functionality
   - Store user role and email in app variables

4. **Build Customer Screens**:
   - Implement ticket creation form
   - Create ticket listing with filtering
   - Build ticket detail view

5. **Build Agent Screens**:
   - Implement ticket assignment functionality
   - Create response interface
   - Add ticket resolution capability

6. **Build Admin Screens**:
   - Create statistics dashboard
   - Implement user management (if applicable)

7. **Testing**:
   - Test all functionality with the backend API
   - Verify role-based access control
   - Test email notifications

## PowerApps Formulas (Examples)

### Retrieving Tickets for Current User
```
ClearCollect(
    UserTickets,
    Filter(
        'API'.GetTickets().value,
        customer_email = User().Email
    )
)
```

### Creating a New Ticket
```
'API'.CreateTicket(
    {
        title: txtTitle.Text,
        description: txtDescription.Text,
        customer_email: User().Email
    }
)
```

### Assigning a Ticket
```
'API'.AssignTicket(
    {
        ticket_id: lblTicketId.Text,
        agent_email: drpAgents.Selected.Value,
        user: User().Email
    }
)
```

### Resolving a Ticket
```
'API'.ResolveTicket(
    {
        ticket_id: lblTicketId.Text,
        resolution: txtResolution.Text,
        user: User().Email
    }
)
```

## UI Design Guidelines

- Use a consistent color scheme (suggested: blue for primary actions, gray for secondary)
- Ensure all screens are responsive and work on mobile devices
- Use clear iconography for status indicators
- Implement consistent navigation between screens
- Use PowerApps components for reusable elements

## Next Steps

1. Implement the design in PowerApps
2. Connect to the Flask backend API
3. Test all functionality
4. Integrate with Power Automate flows for additional automation
