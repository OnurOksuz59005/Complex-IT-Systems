# AI-Powered Customer Support System
## PowerApps Integration & Backend API

### 1. Project Overview

**[SCRIPT]**
"Welcome everyone. Today I'm presenting our AI-Powered Customer Support System, which combines a Flask backend API with a PowerApps frontend. This system modernizes customer support by automating initial responses with AI while maintaining the human touch for complex issues.

Our system serves three user types: customers who submit tickets, agents who resolve them, and administrators who oversee the entire process. The integration between our Flask API and PowerApps creates a seamless experience across these roles."

### 2. Technical Implementation

**[SCRIPT]**
"Let's look at our technical architecture. The backend is built with Python Flask, providing a lightweight yet powerful API framework. For simplicity in this prototype, we're using JSON file persistence, though this can be easily upgraded to a database solution.

The AI component leverages OpenAI's API with a fallback mechanism for reliability. Our frontend is built with Microsoft PowerApps for rapid development and easy integration with other Microsoft products. The entire system is hosted on Render.com, giving us reliable cloud infrastructure without complex DevOps requirements."

### 3. API Design & Integration

**[SCRIPT]**
"The API design was critical for PowerApps integration. We implemented RESTful endpoints following best practices, with a standardized JSON response format that includes success status, message, and data fields.

CORS configuration was carefully implemented to allow cross-origin requests from PowerApps. We've also built comprehensive error handling with try-except blocks and logging throughout the API to ensure reliability and debuggability."

### 4. Key API Endpoints

**[SCRIPT]**
"Our API provides several key endpoints:
- GET and POST methods for '/api/tickets' handle listing and creating tickets
- Individual ticket operations use the ticket ID in the URL
- We have dedicated endpoints for ticket assignment and resolution
- The AI response endpoint can either retrieve an existing response or generate a new one
- And our statistics endpoint provides system-wide metrics for administrators

Each endpoint follows the same response structure for consistency and ease of integration."

---

### 5. PowerApps Integration

**[SCRIPT]**
"PowerApps integration was achieved through HTTP connectors pointing to our Render.com hosted API. The authentication is currently handled with simple API keys, though this could be expanded to OAuth for enterprise deployment.

The data flow is bidirectional - PowerApps sends user inputs to the API and displays the returned data. We've mapped UI components like forms, galleries, and buttons directly to API endpoints, creating a responsive and intuitive interface."

---

### 6. User Experience

**[SCRIPT]**
"Let me walk you through the user experience for each role:

Customers access a simple portal where they can submit new tickets and view responses to their existing ones. The interface is clean and focused on their immediate needs.

Agents have a dashboard showing tickets assigned to them, with tools to provide resolutions and track their performance.

Administrators get an overview of the entire system with statistics on ticket volume, resolution rates, and AI effectiveness."

---

### 7. Testing & Validation

**[SCRIPT]**
"We've thoroughly tested the system at multiple levels:

Our API testing uses a comprehensive test script that verifies all endpoints and edge cases. We've also created a Postman collection for manual testing.

Integration testing confirmed that the PowerApps connector correctly communicates with our API under various conditions.

Performance testing showed that the system maintains good response times even under load, though we've identified some optimization opportunities for future work."

---

### 8. Future Enhancements

**[SCRIPT]**
"While the current system meets our requirements, we've identified several enhancements for future iterations:

Moving from JSON to a proper database would improve scalability and data integrity. Implementing JWT or OAuth would strengthen security. We could add advanced AI features like sentiment analysis to prioritize urgent tickets automatically.

And finally, we could develop a dedicated mobile app for users who prefer native applications over web interfaces."

### 9. Demo

**[SCRIPT]**
"Now, let me demonstrate the system in action. I'll show you:
1. How a customer creates a new ticket
2. The automatic AI response generation
3. An agent assigning and resolving the ticket
4. The admin dashboard with real-time statistics

[PERFORM LIVE DEMO HERE]

As you can see, the workflow is intuitive and efficient, with the AI providing immediate initial responses while agents focus on more complex resolution."

### 10. Q&A

**[SCRIPT]**
"That concludes my presentation. I'm now happy to answer any questions you might have about the system architecture, implementation details, or future development plans.

Thank you for your attention!"
